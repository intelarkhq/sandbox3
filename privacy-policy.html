          <li>Publicly available Discord data (such as user IDs, usernames, messages) is processed in real-time and not permanently stored — it is deleted immediately after fulfilling its intended function.</li>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or disclose your personal data to third parties outside the group of individuals. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App uses Google services (e.g., Google Apps Script and Google API) for back-end functionality and authentication.</li>
        <li>The App may use your data in legitimate requests to other API endpoints, such as retrieving additional profile data (e.g. your ROBLOX username) from your account ID.</li>
        <li>As established previously, the App works with user submitted content. Your data, such as your account ID, may inherently become part of such submitted content, even when not explicitly mentioned by yourself (e.g. you may be automatically listed as the author of a file). This content may be viewable by other third-party users of the App for which the App is not responsible.</li>
        <li>We may disclose your data if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>As users of the App are located worldwide, including in the EU and the United States, your data may be processed or stored in locations where Google services operate. Google provides appropriate safeguards for international data transfers, including adherence to GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and other applicable data protection standards.</p>
